## Testing Activities Completed

### Developer Testing
1. **Unit Testing** - Individual component functionality verified
2. **Integration Testing** - Firebase services integration tested
3. **Build Verification** - Application builds and deploys successfully
4. **Smoke Testing** - Basic user journeys validated

### QA Handoff Preparation
The following activities are now ready for QA team:

1. **Environment Setup** - Follow the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)
2. **Test Planning** - Review [requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) and create test cases
3. **Manual Testing** - Execute functional and exploratory testing
4. **Bug Reporting** - Document any issues found using established processes
5. **Test Automation** - Plan and implement automated test suites

## Known Limitations

### Technical Debt
- Admin user setup requires manual Firestore configuration
- Basic error handling implemented (may need enhancement based on testing feedback)
- Performance optimization not yet completed
- No automated tests included in this phase

### Documentation Gaps
- User manual not yet created (pending QA feedback)
- API documentation minimal (functions are simple)
- Deployment guide needs enhancement

## Deliverables

### Code Artifacts

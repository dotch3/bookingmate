# Test Execution Guidelines

## Overview
This document provides detailed guidelines for executing test activities, including manual test execution, exploratory testing, documentation, and automation planning.

## Step-by-Step Execution Guide

### Step 1: Pre-Execution Setup

**1.1 Environment Preparation**
- Ensure the application is running locally (`npm run dev`)
- Verify all features are accessible
- Prepare test data (user accounts, sample reservations)
- Set up screen recording tools for defect documentation

**1.2 Document Templates Preparation**
- Create Word document template for test execution results
- Create Word document template for exploratory session reports
- Create Word document template for defect reports

### Step 2: Manual Test Case Execution

**2.1 Execute 21 Test Cases**
- Reference: `docs/wiki/testCases.md` for complete test case details
- Execute each test case systematically
- Document results in Word table format:

| TC ID | Title | Status | Defect ID | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| TC01 | User Registration with Valid Data | Passed/Failed/Blocked | DEF-001 (if applicable) | Additional observations |

**2.2 Test Execution Priority Order**
1. **High Priority (13 test cases)**: TC01-TC09, TC13-TC17, TC19-TC20
2. **Medium Priority (7 test cases)**: TC10-TC11, TC18, TC21
3. **Low Priority (1 test case)**: TC12

**2.3 Status Definitions**
- **Passed**: Test executed successfully, expected results achieved
- **Failed**: Test failed due to defect, defect report created
- **Blocked**: Test cannot be executed due to dependency/environment issue

### Step 3: Exploratory Testing with Charters

**3.1 Exploratory Testing Sessions**
Execute exploratory testing using these charters:

**Charter 1: User Authentication Flow**
- Mission: Explore user login, registration, and password reset functionality
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Focus Areas: Security, usability, error handling

**Charter 2: Calendar Navigation and Interaction**
- Mission: Explore calendar view, date navigation, and time slot selection
- Duration: 90 minutes
- Focus Areas: UI responsiveness, data accuracy, edge cases

**Charter 3: Reservation Management**
- Mission: Explore reservation creation, modification, and cancellation
- Duration: 90 minutes
- Focus Areas: Business logic, validation, user feedback

**Charter 4: Admin Panel Functionality**
- Mission: Explore admin features, user management, and system configuration
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Focus Areas: Authorization, data integrity, admin workflows

**Charter 5: Cross-browser and Responsive Testing**
- Mission: Explore application behavior across different browsers and screen sizes
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Focus Areas: Compatibility, responsive design, performance

**3.2 Session Report Template**
For each charter, document:
- Charter details (mission, duration, tester)
- Test environment and setup
- Areas explored
- Issues discovered
- Questions raised
- Recommendations

### Step 4: Defect Documentation

**4.1 Defect Report Template**
For each defect found, create detailed report:
- **Defect ID**: DEF-XXX
- **Title**: Brief description
- **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps
- **Expected Result**: What should happen
- **Actual Result**: What actually happened
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, application version
- **Screenshots/Videos**: Visual evidence
- **Workaround**: If available

### Step 5: Documentation Management

**5.1 Word Documents Creation**
- Create `Test_Execution_Results.docx`
- Create `Exploratory_Testing_Sessions.docx`
- Create `Defect_Reports.docx` (if defects found)

**5.2 Move to Source Documents**
- Place all Word documents in `docs/source-documents/phase-3/`
- Organize by document type and date

**5.3 Convert to Markdown**
- Create corresponding `.md` files in `docs/wiki/`:
  - `TestExecutionResults.md`
  - `ExploratoryTestingSessions.md`
  - `DefectReports.md`
- Ensure proper formatting for wiki display
- Include tables, links, and references

### Step 6: Automation Planning

**6.1 Test Case Analysis for Automation**
Evaluate each test case against automation criteria:

**Automation Suitability Criteria:**
- Repetitive test cases
- Stable functionality
- Clear pass/fail criteria
- No complex user judgment required
- High business value
- Regression testing candidates

**6.2 Automation Candidate Classification**
Create automation readiness matrix:

| TC ID | Title | Automation Suitable | Priority | Complexity | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------------------|----------|------------|-------|
| TC01 | User Registration | Yes | High | Medium | Good candidate for form automation |
| TC02 | User Login | Yes | High | Low | Simple form validation |

**6.3 Automation Test Suite Planning**
- **High Priority for Automation**: Login, Registration, Basic Reservation Flow
- **Medium Priority**: Calendar Navigation, Admin Functions
- **Low Priority**: Complex UI interactions, Visual validations

**6.4 Cypress Test Structure Planning**
Prepare test organization:
```
cypress/
├── e2e/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── login.cy.js
│   │   └── registration.cy.js
│   ├── reservations/
│   │   ├── create-reservation.cy.js
│   │   └── manage-reservation.cy.js
│   └── admin/
│       └── admin-panel.cy.js
├── fixtures/
└── support/
```

### Step 7: Final Documentation and Reporting

**7.1 Test Summary Report**
Create comprehensive summary including:
- Total test cases executed
- Pass/Fail/Blocked statistics
- Defect summary and severity breakdown
- Exploratory testing insights
- Automation recommendations
- Overall quality assessment

**7.2 Completion Checklist**

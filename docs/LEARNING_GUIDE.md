# BookingMate Learning Guide

This guide provides educational information for learners and instructors using the BookingMate project to practice QA skills and methodologies.

## üéØ For Learners

### Getting Started
1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Read this README** to understand the project structure
3. **Switch to `phase-1-implementation`** to see the working application
4. **Follow phases sequentially** to experience the complete QA workflow
5. **Practice each phase's activities** before moving to the next

### Learning Path
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world QA practices:

1. **Phase 1**: Understand the implemented application and requirements
2. **Phase 2**: Learn test planning and strategy development
3. **Phase 3**: Practice manual testing and bug reporting
4. **Phase 4**: Implement test automation
5. **Phase 5**: Experience bug fixing and regression testing

## üë®‚Äçüè´ For Instructors

### Educational Structure
- Each phase branch contains detailed README with learning objectives
- Branches can be used as checkpoints for student progress

- **Problem Solving**: Debugging and root cause analysis

## üìö Learning Resources

### Phase-Specific Materials
Each phase branch contains:
- üìñ **Detailed README** with phase objectives
- üìã **Templates and examples** for deliverables
- üîß **Setup instructions** for tools and environments
- üìä **Sample reports** and documentation
- üí° **Best practices** and tips

### Additional Resources
- **[Requirements Document](REQUIREMENTS.md)** - Complete project specifications
- **[Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - Technical setup instructions
- **[Phase 1 Documentation](PHASE_1.md)** - Development completion details
- **[Test Documentation](wiki/Home.md)** - Comprehensive testing artifacts

## üåü Branching Strategy & Project Phases

**IMPORTANT**: The `main` branch contains only project overview. All development work and detailed documentation are organized in separate branches corresponding to each project phase.

### Branch Structure

- **`main`** (current): Project overview and branching strategy
- **`phase-1-implementation`**: Core application development
- **`phase-2-test-planning`**: Test strategy and test case creation
- **`phase-3-test-execution`**: Manual testing and bug reporting
- **`phase-4-test-automation`**: Automated testing implementation
- **`phase-5-fixes-regression`**: Bug fixes and regression testing

### How to Navigate the Project

1. **Start here** (main branch) to understand the overall project structure
2. **Switch to specific phase branches** to see detailed work for each phase
3. **Follow the phases sequentially** to experience the complete QA workflow
4. **Check each branch's README** for phase-specific objectives and deliverables

### Branch Navigation Commands
```bash
# View all branches
git branch -a

# Switch to a specific phase
git checkout phase-1-implementation
git checkout phase-2-test-planning
git checkout phase-3-test-execution
git checkout phase-4-test-automation
git checkout phase-5-fixes-regression

# Return to main overview
git checkout main
```

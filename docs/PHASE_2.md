- ✅ **User Interface Testing** - Responsive design and usability
- ✅ **Integration Testing** - Firebase services integration
- ✅ **Security Testing** - Authentication and authorization
- ✅ **Data Validation Testing** - Input validation and data integrity

### Testing Limitations & Exclusions

#### Platform Limitations
- ❌ **Mobile Device Testing** - No native mobile app testing
- ❌ **Cross-Browser Compatibility** - Limited to Chrome/Firefox/Edge
- ❌ **Performance Testing** - Load and stress testing not included
- ❌ **API Testing** - Direct Firebase API testing excluded

#### Technical Constraints
- **Environment Restriction** - Testing limited to web interface only
- **Device Coverage** - Desktop and laptop browsers only
- **Network Conditions** - Standard connectivity assumed
- **Accessibility Testing** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Test Techniques Applied

### Equivalence Partitioning Implementation
- **Time Slot Selection**: Valid slots (8-12, 13-17, 18-22) vs invalid times
- **User Roles**: Admin vs Regular user permission testing
- **Reservation Capacity**: Within limit (0-2) vs over limit (3+) scenarios

### Boundary Value Analysis
- **Capacity Limits**: Testing at 0, 1, 2, and 3 reservations per slot
- **Time Boundaries**: Slot start/end times and transitions
- **Input Field Limits**: Maximum character lengths for text fields

### Exploratory Testing Charters
1. **User Journey Exploration** - End-to-end workflow validation
2. **Error Handling Discovery** - Edge case and error scenario testing
3. **Usability Assessment** - User experience and interface evaluation
4. **Data Integrity Validation** - Real-time updates and synchronization
5. **Security Boundary Testing** - Access control and permission validation

## 4. Exploratory Testing Strategy

### Testing Missions

| Charter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Charter 1: Create reservations (common user and admin)** | Explore the reservation creation flow as a common user applying the heuristic "Testing wisdom - One test is an experiment designed to reveal information." Cover available time slots (morning, afternoon, evening) and error handling when slots are unavailable. |
| **Charter 2: Manage users (admin)** | Explore user creation, edition, and deletion as an admin using heuristics "CRUD" and "Strings." Try long names, special characters, blank fields, duplicate emails, and invalid inputs. Verify role assignment (user/admin) and confirm common users cannot access user management. |
| **Charter 3: Cancel reservations (common user and admin)** | Explore cancelation of reservations applying the heuristic "Risk Testing â€“ imagine a problem and then look for it." Include common user canceling their own reservations, and admin canceling both their own and other users' reservations. |
| **Charter 4: View reservations (common user and admin)** | Explore the navigation and display of reservations applying the heuristic "Navigation." Verify that a common user only sees their own reservations (or a message if none exist), and that an admin can list and manage reservations for all users. |
| **Charter 5: Manage reservations (admin)** | Explore editing and deleting reservations as an admin using heuristics "CRUD" and "Error Guessing." Verify successful updates, consistent deletion behavior, and correct feedback messages on the interface. |

## 5. Non-Functional Testing Strategy

| Type | Description | Expected Result |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Security Testing** | Attempt unauthorized access, injection attacks | All actions are blocked or sanitized |
| **Cross-browser Testing** | Run BookingMate on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions) and verify UI compatibility | BookingMate displays correctly and functions consistently across all tested browsers |
| **Accessibility Testing** | Evaluate BookingMate pages with screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, and color contrast tools | BookingMate meets at least WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility |
| **Performance Testing** | Validate the login of 100 users concurrently | System handles it without lag and meets (p95 <=100 ms) |

---

## 6. Automated Testing Strategy

| ID | Condition | Expected Result | Layer |
|----|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| 1  | Common user logged in selects morning on a day with < 2 reservations in morning | Reservation is created successfully. A green toast is displayed. UI updates showing user's name in the reservation list. | Web |
| 2  | Common user attempts to create a reservation in a full afternoon slot (2 already created) | Reservation is not created. UI shows "Slot is full" and does not offer the link to reserve. | Web |
| 3  | Admin user cancels another user's reservation | Reservation is deleted. A success toast is shown. UI updates removing the reservation from the list. | Web |
| 4  | Admin edits a reservation to another slot with capacity | Reservation updated. A success toast is shown. UI list reflects the updated slot and time. | Web |

## 7. Test Data Management

| Test Data | Type | Responsible | Status |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| Common user with no reservations | Database Record | Jorge Mercado | To do |
| Common user with 3 reservations on a date | Database Record | Jorge Mercado | To do |
| Admin user | Database Record | Jorge Mercado | To do |
| Day with full slot in the afternoon | Database Record | Jorge Mercado | To do |

## 9. Test Execution Strategy

### Phase 3 Preparation
This test plan serves as the foundation for Phase 3 test execution activities, which will include:

- **Manual Test Execution**: Execute all 21 test cases systematically
- **Exploratory Testing Sessions**: Conduct 5 chartered exploratory missions
- **Bug Reporting**: Document and track any defects found
- **Test Results Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive test execution records

### Success Criteria
- All high-priority test cases executed successfully
- Critical defects identified and documented
- Test coverage goals achieved (100% user story coverage)
- Exploratory testing sessions completed

## Related Documentation

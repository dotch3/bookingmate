## 🤖 Development Notes

### AI-Assisted Development
This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools, supervised to maintain project scope and avoid unnecessary complexity that could complicate the development process. The AI was used to:

- Generate comprehensive requirements documentation (simulating Product Owner specifications)
- Create realistic development artifacts and documentation  
- Simulate the collaborative interaction between Product Owner, QA, and development teams
- Maintain focus on Phase 1 deliverables while avoiding scope creep

This approach follows the **"Three Amigos"** methodology <mcreference link="https://agilealliance.org/glossary/three-amigos/" index="1">1</mcreference>, where Business Analysts (Product Owner), Developers, and Quality Assurance professionals collaborate to examine work increments from different perspectives: Business (what problem to solve), Development (how to build the solution), and Testing (what could possibly happen). This collaboration ensures shared understanding and successful delivery while preventing any single perspective from dominating the process.


### Known Limitations
- Admin user setup requires manual Firestore configuration
- No automated tests included in this phase
- Basic error handling implemented (may need enhancement)
- Performance optimization not yet completed

### Next Phase: Test Planning (phase-2-test-planning) ⏳
The QA team can now begin:
1. **Environment Setup** - Follow the setup instructions above
2. **Test Planning** - Review requirements and create test cases
3. **Manual Testing** - Execute functional and exploratory testing
4. **Bug Reporting** - Document any issues found
5. **Test Automation** - Implement automated test suites

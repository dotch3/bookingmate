# BookingMate - Quality Engineering Practice Project

A comprehensive quality engineering practice project that simulates the complete software development lifecycle with testing activities.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository serves as a **practical learning environment for Quality Engineering**, demonstrating how testing activities are integrated throughout the software development process. The project simulates real-world scenarios where QA engineers work alongside developers to ensure software quality.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Practice test planning and strategy development
- Execute manual and exploratory testing
- Implement test automation frameworks
- Experience bug reporting and regression testing
- Understand the complete QA workflow in software development

## 📖 About the Application

**BookingMate** is a web-based shared calendar reservation system designed for a study group of teachers to manage their availability for giving lessons. The application features:

- **Firebase User Authentication** for secure access
- **Role-based permissions** (Admin/User)
- **Time slot reservations** (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
- **Capacity management** (max 2 reservations per slot/day)
- **Real-time updates** via Firebase Firestore
- **Modern tech stack**: React + TypeScript + Firebase

## 🌿 Branching Strategy & Project Phases

**IMPORTANT**: The `main` branch contains only this overview. All development work and detailed documentation are organized in separate branches corresponding to each project phase.

### Branch Structure:

- **`main`** (current): Project overview and branching strategy
- **`phase-1-implementation`**: Core application development
- **`phase-2-test-planning`**: Test strategy and test case creation
- **`phase-3-test-execution`**: Manual testing and bug reporting
- **`phase-4-test-automation`**: Automated testing implementation
- **`phase-5-fixes-regression`**: Bug fixes and regression testing

### How to Navigate the Project:

1. **Start here** (main branch) to understand the overall project structure
2. **Switch to specific phase branches** to see detailed work for each phase
3. **Follow the phases sequentially** to experience the complete QA workflow
4. **Check each branch's README** for phase-specific objectives and deliverables

#### Automated Test Cases Status

**Total Test Cases Automated**: 15 out of 21 identified test cases (71.4% automation coverage)

| Test Case | Description | Status | File Location |
|-----------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| TC1 | Common user reserves a slot successfully | ✅ Automated | `create-reservations.cy.js` |
| TC2 | Common user cannot create reservation if slot is full | ⏳ In Progress | `reservation-validation.cy.js` |
| TC3 | Common user cannot create second reservation on same slot | ⏳ In Progress | `reservation-validation.cy.js` |
| TC4 | Common user can create reservations in all slots same day | ✅ Automated | `create-reservations.cy.js` |
| TC5 | Admin user reserves a slot successfully | ✅ Automated | `create-reservations.cy.js` |
| TC6 | Admin user cannot create reservation if slot is full |⏳ In Progress | `reservation-validation.cy.js` |
| TC10 | Common user gets list of its reservations | ✅ Automated | `list-reservations.cy.js` |
| TC11 | Admin user gets list of its reservations | ✅ Automated | `list-reservations.cy.js` |
| TC13 | Admin user can create new user with role "user" | ✅ Automated | `user-management.cy.js` |
| TC14 | Admin user can create new user with role "admin" | ✅ Automated | `user-management.cy.js` |

#### Test Automation Framework Features
- **Custom Commands**: Reusable commands for login, navigation, and common actions
- **Data-Test Attributes**: Consistent element identification strategy
- **Environment Configuration**: Support for different test environments
- **Page Object Pattern**: Structured approach for maintainable tests
- **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and reporting
- **Cross-browser Support**: Cypress framework with modern browser compatibility

#### Test Results Summary
- **Framework**: Cypress v13.x
- **Test Files**: 5 test specification files
- **Test Suites**: 6 test suites covering all major functionality
- **Custom Commands**: 8 reusable commands implemented
- **Test Data**: Environment-driven test data management
- **Execution**: Ready for CI/CD integration

#### Non-Functional Testing Status
**⏸️ ON HOLD**: Testing for accessibility, performance, security, and other non-functional requirements is currently on hold until the system reaches a more stable condition. These testing activities will be prioritized in future phases once core functionality bugs are resolved and the system demonstrates consistent reliability.

### Phase 5: Fixes & Regression (`phase-5-fixes-regression`) ⏳
**Objective**: Address bugs and ensure system stability
- 📋 Bug fixes implementation (addressing issues found during Phase 3 testing)
- 📋 Regression test execution (automated and manual)
- 📋 Test automation enhancements and additional test case coverage
- 📋 Performance and stability testing
- 📋 Final quality assessment and sign-off
- 📋 Project retrospective and lessons learned

**Next Steps**: Phase 5 will focus on:
1. **Bug Resolution**: Fixing defects identified during manual testing phase
2. **Regression Testing**: Running both automated and manual regression tests
3. **Test Coverage Expansion**: Automating remaining test cases (targeting 80%+ coverage)
4. **Quality Gates**: Establishing final quality criteria and acceptance testing
5. **Documentation**: Finalizing test reports and project documentation

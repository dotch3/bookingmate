  - 15 automated test cases covering 71.4% of identified test scenarios
  - Custom commands for reusable test actions (login, navigation, validation)
  - Environment-driven configuration with data-test attributes
  - Robust element selection and error handling
  - Test execution and reporting capabilities
  - Cross-browser compatibility with modern Cypress framework

### Test Planning Artifacts (Phase 2 Complete)
- **[Test Plan and Strategy](docs/wiki/TestStrategyAndPlan.md)** - Complete test plan
- **[Test Cases](docs/wiki/TestCases.md)** - 21 comprehensive test cases covering all user stories

### Coverage Analysis
- **User Stories Covered**: 5/5 (100%)
- **Test Conditions**: 27 conditions across all functional areas
- **Test Cases**: 21 detailed test cases
- **Priority Distribution**: 13 High priority, 7 Medium priority, 1 Low priority
- **Testing Layers**: Web layer focus with comprehensive UI testing

## üéØ Project Purpose

This repository serves as a **practical learning environment for Quality Engineering**, demonstrating how testing activities are integrated throughout the software development process. The project simulates real-world scenarios where QA engineers work alongside developers to ensure software quality.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Practice test planning and strategy development
- Execute manual and exploratory testing
- Implement test automation frameworks
- Experience bug reporting and regression testing
- Understand the complete QA workflow in software development

## üåø Branching Strategy & Project Phases

**IMPORTANT**: The `main` branch contains only this overview. All development work and detailed documentation are organized in separate branches corresponding to each project phase.

### Branch Structure:

- **`main`** (current): Project overview and branching strategy
- **`phase-1-implementation`**: Core application development
- **`phase-2-test-planning`**: Test strategy and test case creation
- **`phase-3-test-execution`**: Manual testing and bug reporting
- **`phase-4-test-automation`**: Automated testing implementation
- **`phase-5-fixes-regression`**: Bug fixes and regression testing

### How to Navigate the Project:

1. **Start here** (main branch) to understand the overall project structure
2. **Switch to specific phase branches** to see detailed work for each phase
3. **Follow the phases sequentially** to experience the complete QA workflow
4. **Check each branch's README** for phase-specific objectives and deliverables

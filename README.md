## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase account
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dotch3/bookingmate.git
   cd bookingmate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Firebase Functions dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

### Firebase Setup

1. **Create a Firebase project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password provider)
   - Create a Firestore database

2. **Configure Firebase**
   - Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
   - Login: `firebase login`
   - Initialize: `firebase init` (select Firestore, Functions, Hosting)

3. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Deploy Firebase Functions** (optional)
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

3. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Default Admin User
After setting up Firebase Auth, create an admin user and manually add the `admin` field to their role in the user document in Firestore.

## 🔄 Phase 1

### Development Status
- ✅ **Code Complete**: All features from requirements have been implemented
- ✅ **Self-Testing**: Basic developer testing completed
- ✅ **Build Verification**: Application builds and runs successfully
- ✅ **Documentation**: Setup instructions and requirements provided

### Testing Activities
The QA team can now begin:
1. **Environment Setup** - Follow the setup instructions above
2. **Test Planning** - Review requirements and create test cases
3. **Manual Testing** - Execute functional and exploratory testing
4. **Bug Reporting** - Document any issues found
5. **Test Automation** - Implement automated test suites

### Known Limitations
- Admin user setup requires manual Firestore configuration
- No automated tests included in this phase
- Basic error handling implemented (may need enhancement)
- Performance optimization not yet completed

### Next Steps
After QA validation, the team will proceed to:
- **Phase 2**: Test Planning and Strategy
- **Phase 3**: Test Execution and Bug Reporting
- **Phase 4**: Test Automation Implementation
- **Phase 5**: Bug Fixes and Regression Testing

## 🤖 Development Notes

### AI-Assisted Development
This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools, supervised to maintain project scope and avoid unnecessary complexity that could complicate the development process. The AI was used to:

- Generate comprehensive requirements documentation (simulating Product Owner specifications)
- Create realistic development artifacts and documentation  
- Simulate the collaborative interaction between Product Owner, QA, and development teams
- Maintain focus on Phase 1 deliverables while avoiding scope creep

This approach follows the **"Three Amigos"** methodology <mcreference link="https://agilealliance.org/glossary/three-amigos/" index="1">1</mcreference>, where Business Analysts (Product Owner), Developers, and Quality Assurance professionals collaborate to examine work increments from different perspectives: Business (what problem to solve), Development (how to build the solution), and Testing (what could possibly happen). This collaboration ensures shared understanding and successful delivery while preventing any single perspective from dominating the process.

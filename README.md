# BookingMate - Phase 3: Test Execution

**Status**: ⏳ Phase 3 In Progress - Test Execution and Bug Reporting

---

## 📋 Phase 3 Overview

The Quality Engineering team is now executing comprehensive **manual testing and bug reporting** for the BookingMate application. Following the completed test planning phase, we are systematically executing test cases, conducting exploratory testing sessions, and documenting findings based on ISO-29119-3 standards.

## Test Execution Artifacts

  - Step-by-step test execution process
  - Manual testing procedures and protocols
  - Exploratory testing session guidelines
  - Defect reporting and tracking procedures
  - Documentation management workflows
  - Automation planning criteria

- **[Test Case Execution](docs/wiki/TestCaseExecution.md)** - Execution tracking including:
  - Test case status tracking
  - Execution progress metrics
  - Status definitions and workflow

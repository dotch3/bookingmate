# BookingMate - Phase 4: Test Automation

**Status**: ⏳ Phase 4 In Progress - Test Automation Implementation
---

## 📋 Phase 4 Overview

The Quality Engineering team is now implementing **automated testing** for the BookingMate application. Following the completed test execution phase, we are developing Cypress test automation scripts for the test cases identified as automation candidates.

## Test Automation Artifacts

### Phase 4 Documentation
Comprehensive test automation framework has been implemented:

- **[Cypress Test Suite](test/README.md)** - Complete automation framework including:
  - 18 automated test cases covering 85.7% of identified test scenarios
  - Custom commands for reusable test actions
  - Environment-driven configuration
  - Test execution and reporting capabilities

### Test Planning Artifacts (Phase 2 Complete)
- **[Test Plan and Strategy](docs/wiki/TestStrategyAndPlan.md)** - Complete test plan
- **[Test Cases](docs/wiki/TestCases.md)** - 21 comprehensive test cases covering all user stories

### Coverage Analysis
- **User Stories Covered**: 5/5 (100%)
- **Test Conditions**: 27 conditions across all functional areas
- **Test Cases**: 21 detailed test cases
- **Priority Distribution**: 13 High priority, 7 Medium priority, 1 Low priority
- **Testing Layers**: Web layer focus with comprehensive UI testing
